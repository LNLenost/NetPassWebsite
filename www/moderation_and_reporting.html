			<h2>Moderation and Reporting</h2>
			<h3>How do I report unwanted/inappropriate content?</h3>
			<p>If you found something that breaks one of our <a href="https://netpass.cafe/rules.html">Rules</a>, or
				believe you found something harmful not yet covered by our rules you can send a report using the
				following steps:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>In NetPass, go to <strong>Settings → Report a user</strong></li>
				<li>On the report screen, you can scroll and choose who to report. Clicking on a name will show the
					offender's name and associated StreetPass Data (including a preview of their SwapNote
					drawing).
					<br><i class="fa-solid fa-circle-exclamation" aria-label="Notice:" role="img"></i>
					This will NOT YET send the report! You can safely check the data and back out by pressing B if it's
					the wrong person.
				</li>
				<li>Once you have selected the offender, click the A button to begin writing a report. Please include
					as much context as you can fit in the text box.</li>
			</ol>
			<p>If you cancel the report at any of the above steps it will not be sent.</p>

			<h2>Related Questions</h2>
			<h3>How do I format a good report?</h3>
			<p>Please include the following in your reports:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What content was offensive (You may quote offensive messages, as it helps us to find and verify
					them)</li>
				<li>The game the offensive content is in</li>
				<li>If it's not covered by our rules: Why you think it should be banned</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>Can I be banned for sending fake reports?</h3>
			<p>If they were in bad faith, yes. If it's apparent that you accidentally reported the wrong user you will
				not be punished for it. We keep track of every user's fake reports and adjust punishment
				accordingly.</p>
			<h3>Is there a time limit to report someone?</h3>
			<p>Yes there is, so please report users immediately. NetPass only stores the StreetPass data for 15 days,
				after which it gets deleted and cannot be reported anymore.</p>
			<h3>Can I appeal a ban?</h3>
			<p>You may appeal a ban if you are convinced that the moderation team has made some sort of mistake. If
				that isn't the case then the ban cannot be lifted, shortened or otherwise be edited. To appeal a ban
				please open a ticket in the #mod-mail channel in our Discord Community.</p>
