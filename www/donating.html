            <h2>Donating</h2>
            <p>Running the NetPass servers isn't free and puts additional financial stress on the developer. Donations
                like these have lifted that stress and allow NetPass to continue running for the foreseeable
                future!</p>
            <p>As a thank you for their kindness, donators receive the option to mark their Mii as "special"!</p>
            <h3>How to donate (and mark your Mii as special)</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="login.html">Log in</a> on the website</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>First time log in has to be with a 3DS, you can add other login methods later</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Go to the Subscriptions tab and hit Subscribe</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Alternative ways to donate</h3>
            <p>Note: These options will not allow you to mark your Mii as "special"!</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Anonymously through <a href="https://liberapay.com/Sorunome">Liberapay</a></li>
                <li>Using your Twitch "Prime Sub" (gained by <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/prime">linking an Amazon
                    Prime subscription to Twitch</a>) to subscribe to the <a href="https://twitch.tv/sorunome">
                    developer's Twitch channel</a></li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Note that you have to resubscribe every month as it doesn't auto-extend</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h2>Related Questions</h2>
            <h3>What is a "special" Mii?</h3>
            <p>Special Miis were Miis that were distributed by Nintendo over SpotPass. They wear golden pants and
                grant certain benefits in StreetPass Mii Plaza minigames to players who meet them.</p>
            <h3>Do I have to make my Mii special with SpecializeMii?</h3>
            <p>The NetPass server modifies your StreetPass data to change the special status of your Mii. As such,
                homebrews like SpecializeMii have zero effect. To change your special status, please log back into
                the website and adjust your settings.</p>
            <h3>How many consoles can I connect?</h3>
            <p>You can add as many consoles as you'd like and they will all get the option to send their Mii as a
                special one!</p>
            <h3>Why lock special Miis behind a paywall?</h3>
            <p>The goal of NetPass has always been to restore StreetPass in a way that felt natural. Special Miis
                are supposed to feel special, rare even. You should be excited when meeting one. This compromise
                allows special Miis to continue to exist while not overflooding everyone with them. Additionally,
                it helps to fund the costs of the server that NetPass relies on!</p>
