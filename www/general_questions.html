			<h2>General Questions</h2>
			<h3>What is SPR?</h3>
			<p>SPR stands for StreetPass Relay, which is a feature that allows your 3DS to download StreetPasses in the
				background while you keep it on idle or play your games.</p>
			<h3>What is a &quot;Pass&quot;?</h3>
			<p>Short for StreetPass, we call a &quot;Pass&quot; a successful StreetPass exchange.</p>
			<h3>What decides when and with who I will StreetPass?</h3>
			<p>There are hundreds of users in each NetPass location at any given time but you're not guaranteed to meet
				all of them (and definitely not immediately). Instead the server matches you with a randomly selected
				few of them at its own pace over the course of your 10 hours there.</p>
			<h3>Do I have to leave the app open?</h3>
			<p>No, all StreetPass pairing happens on the server-side. You may receive these passes via SPR or by
				opening the app.</p>
			<h3>How do I leave a location?</h3>
			<p>You will not be able to leave your location until your 10 hour cooldown is over.</p>
			<h3>Why do I have X amount of inbox/outbox?</h3>
			<p>That number represents how many games that have StreetPass enabled. For example: if you have 6, NetPass
				will show and download data for those 6 games.</p>
			<h3>I saw content that is breaking the rules. How do I report it?</h3>
			<p>Please refer to the <a href="moderation_and_reporting.html">Moderation and Reporting</a> section.</p>
			<h3>Will normal StreetPass still work?</h3>
			<p>Yes, it will.</p>
			<h3>My friend and I went to the same location, but we didn&#39;t pass each other. What gives?</h3>
			<p>The passes inside a location are totally random; for user-specific passes, you might be interested in
				Pretendo&#39;s version of StreetPass Relay.</p>
			<h3>How is my data stored?</h3>
			<p>See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a></p>
			<h3>Where can I download/delete my data?</h3>
			<p>You can both download and request the deletion of your data within the NetPass settings.</p>
			<h3>If I get banned from NetPass, will I also get banned on Nintendo/Pretendo, and vice versa?</h3>
			<p>No, we are different services and thus have different moderation teams.</p>
			<h3>The StreetPass inbox for one of my games is full! Will my passes be deleted if I don’t clear it?</h3>
			<p>The server will continue to accumulate and hold onto passes for you, until you clear your inbox or 15
				days pass.</p>
			<h3>Does NetPass work on Emulators?</h3>
			<p>NetPass is intended to be ran on official 3DS hardware.</p>
			<p>Emulators are not blocked, but simply don't emulate the 3DS accurately enough as of right now to allow
				NetPass to function properly. It is not a flaw of NetPass and therefore cannot be fixed by us.</p>
			<h3>If I receive someone's pass, do they receive mine?</h3>
			<p>Yes! NetPass always exchanges both of your StreetPass data, meaning you both Streetpass each other! The
				only exception is if you scan a QR code, where you only receive data.</p>
			<h3>How fast will I get passes?</h3>
			<p>You should expect to get roughly 1 StreetPass per hour on average, but it can vary. Close NetPass, let
				it do its thing and check in again in a few hours!</p>
