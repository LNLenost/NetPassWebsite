            <h2>Onboarding</h2>
            <p>Before you can use NetPass, an onboarding message will prompt you to install additional patches for
                additional features. This is a highly recommended, but ultimately optional step. You will need to
                enable sysmodule game patching in your Luma settings for the patches to work properly (you can do this
                by holding down on the Select button when your 3DS is booting up). After these patches are installed
                and you’ve enabled game patching, <b>make sure your 3DS system reboots</b> before opening NetPass
                again. If an update to the patches is available, the onboarding screen will appear again.</p>

            <h2>Getting StreetPasses</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Firstly, launch NetPass; your StreetPass data will begin to upload onto the server.</li>
                <li>After your data is uploaded, you will see 6 different locations; once you choose and enter a
                    location, you will begin to randomly pass people in that location for the next 10 hours.</li>
            </ol>
            <h2>Important Notes:</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You are unable to change or leave your location until your 10 hours have run out.</li>
                <li>After the 10-hour period ends, you will automatically leave the location, and then need to enter a
                    different one to receive more passes.</li>
                <li>All NetPass locations are equally as likely to give you passes; there’s no ‘busy’ or ‘less busy’
                    option.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section id="faq">
            <h2>General Questions</h2>
            <h3>What is SPR?</h3>
            <p>SPR stands for StreetPass Relay, which is a feature that allows your 3DS to download StreetPasses in the
                background while you keep it on idle or play your games.</p>
            <h3>What is a &quot;Pass&quot;?</h3>
            <p>Short for StreetPass, we call a &quot;Pass&quot; a successful StreetPass exchange.</p>
            <h3>What decides when and with who I will StreetPass?</h3>
            <p>There are hundreds of users in each NetPass location at any given time but you're not guaranteed to meet
                all of them (and definitely not immediately). Instead the server matches you with a randomly selected
                few of them at its own pace over the course of your 10 hours there.</p>
            <h3>Do I have to leave the app open?</h3>
            <p>No, all StreetPass pairing happens on the server-side. You may receive these passes via SPR or by
                opening the app.</p>
            <h3>How do I leave a location?</h3>
            <p>You will not be able to leave your location until your 10 hour cooldown is over.</p>
            <h3>Why do I have X amount of inbox/outbox?</h3>
            <p>That number represents how many games that have StreetPass enabled. For example: if you have 6, NetPass
                will show and download data for those 6 games.</p>
            <h3>I saw content that is breaking the rules. How do I report it?</h3>
            <p>Please refer to the <a href="#moderation-reporting">Moderation and Reporting</a> section.</p>
            <h3>Will normal StreetPass still work?</h3>
            <p>Yes, it will.</p>
            <h3>My friend and I went to the same location, but we didn&#39;t pass each other. What gives?</h3>
            <p>The passes inside a location are totally random; for user-specific passes, you might be interested in
                Pretendo&#39;s version of StreetPass Relay.</p>
            <h3>How is my data stored?</h3>
            <p>See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a></p>
            <h3>Where can I download/delete my data?</h3>
            <p>You can both download and request the deletion of your data within the NetPass settings.</p>
            <h3>If I get banned from NetPass, will I also get banned on Nintendo/Pretendo, and vice versa?</h3>
            <p>No, we are different services and thus have different moderation teams.</p>
            <h3>The StreetPass inbox for one of my games is full! Will my passes be deleted if I don’t clear it?</h3>
            <p>The server will continue to accumulate and hold onto passes for you, until you clear your inbox or 15
                days pass.</p>
            <h3>Does NetPass work on Emulators?</h3>
            <p>NetPass is intended to be ran on official 3DS hardware.</p>
            <p>Emulators are not blocked, but simply don't emulate the 3DS accurately enough as of right now to allow
                NetPass to function properly. It is not a flaw of NetPass and therefore cannot be fixed by us.</p>

        <section id="back-alley">
            <h2>Back Alley</h2>
            <h3>What is the Back Alley?</h3>
            <p>The Back Alley is a mechanism meant for getting passes on specific games using Play Coins.</p>
            <h3>How do I use it?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Open NetPass</li>
                <li>Enter a location and select &quot;Back Alley&quot;</li>
                <li>
                    Press A to buy a pass
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>You can only buy 6 passes per day (1 free), it resets at midnight</strong></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Select the game you want to get a pass for
                    <ul>
                        <li>You should now have a new pass in the app you bought one for!</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>I didn&#39;t get my back alley pass...?</h3>
            <p>Sadly, a bug known as a <strong>phantom pass</strong> might be the reason for that; more information
                about it on <a href="#known-errors">Known Errors</a>.</p>
            <h3>I can&#39;t buy any more passes even though I still didn&#39;t reach the limit.</h3>
            <p>You ran out of Play Coins.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>You can walk while taking your 3DS with you while in sleep mode (limit of 10 per day), or use
                    homebrew apps like <strong><a
                    href="https://db.universal-team.net/3ds/fastplaycoin">FastPlayCoin</a></strong>,

            </ul>

            <h2>Settings</h2>
            <h3>What does the QR code scanner do?</h3>
            <p>For clarification, this feature is not related to the remote installation process seen in the <a
                href="install.html">Installation Guide</a>.</p>
            <p>The "Scan QR Code" option in the NetPass settings will activate the outer camera on your 3DS (with the
                inner camera being an option as well.)
            <p>This QR code scanner is used for:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Logging into the NetPass website for the first time</strong>. This connects your console
                     to your account which allows you to receive <a href="#donating">donation perks</a>. You can set
                      up alternative login options via Reddit, Gitlab or Discord after that.</li>
                <li><strong>Receiving specific StreetPasses</strong>. Note that this will be a one-sided StreetPass
                     download, so the QR code creator won't receive your StreetPass. A guide to create such QR codes
                      yourself to spread your StreetPass data is provided further down.</li>
                <li><strong>Joining time-limited event locations</strong>. From time to time special event locations
                     will be accessible via a QR code, generally offering more StreetPasses than regular locations.
                      There's no schedule for when these locations will appear, or where the QR codes will be shared.
                       Please refrain from asking/demanding for them.</li>

            </ol>
            <h3>What is the "Integrations" button for? What happens if I turn the Pretendo one on/off?</h3>
            <p>The Integrations option you see under your settings is meant for configuring 3rd party services. At the
                 moment, NetPass only offers a Pretendo integration that adds compatibility to Pretendo's SPR.</p>
            <p>With the Pretendo integration, NetPass is able to download passes from your Pretendo friends list and
                distribute them as if they came from NetPass. Otherwise, with this integration toggled off, NetPass SPR
                will block Pretendo SPR passes.</p>
            <p>As a final disclaimer, third party integrations are outside of NetPass moderation and should be used at
                your own risk.</p>

            <h3>How do I report unwanted/inappropriate content?</h3>
            <p>If you found something that breaks one of our <a href="https://netpass.cafe/rules.html">Rules</a>, or
                 believe you found something harmful not yet covered by our rules you can send a report using the
                  following steps:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>In your in-app settings, there should be a report button.</li>
                <li>On the report screen, you can scroll and choose who to report. Clicking on a name will show the
                    offender’s name and associated StreetPass Data (including a preview of their SwapNote
                    drawing).</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>This will NOT YET send the report! You can safely check the data and back out by pressing B
                         if it's the wrong person.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Once you have selected the offender, click the A button to begin writing a report. Please include
                    as much context as you can fit in the text box.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you cancel the report at any of the above steps it will not be sent. If you submit your written
                report it will be sent to the mod panel, which mods will validate and give punishment if necessary.
                 All reports are manually reviewed, so please avoid submitting fake reports/spam; those who do will
                  be punished.</p>

            <h2>Donating</h2>
            <p>Running the NetPass servers isn't free and puts additional financial stress on the developer. Donations

            <h2>Related Questions</h2>
            <h3>What is a "special" Mii?</h3>
            <p>Special Miis were Miis that were distributed by Nintendo over SpotPass. They wear golden pants and
                 grant certain benefits in StreetPass Mii Plaza minigames to players who meet them.</p>
            <h3>Do I have to make my Mii special with SpecializeMii?</h3>
            <p>The NetPass server modifies your StreetPass data to change the special status of your Mii. As such,
                 homebrews like SpecializeMii have zero effect. To change your special status, please log back into
                  the website and adjust your settings.</p>
            <h3>How many consoles can I connect?</h3>
            <p>You can add as many consoles as you'd like and they will all get the option to send their Mii as a
                 special one!</p>
            <h3>Why lock special Miis behind a paywall?</h3>
            <p>The goal of NetPass has always been to restore StreetPass in a way that felt natural. Special Miis
                 are supposed to feel special, rare even. You should be excited when meeting one. This compromise
                  allows special Miis to continue to exist while not overflooding everyone with them. Additionally,
                   it helps to fund the costs of the server that NetPass relies on!</p>

            <h3>“HTTP 403: Forbidden”</h3>
            <p>The server is refusing the request from your console.</p>
            <p>You are most likely banned. Please use a recent version of NetPass in order to see the infraction,
                 time of ban and time of unban on the top screen. If you do not get a ban message, or have questions
                  surrounding your ban, please open a ticket our Discord&#39;s Mod Mail channel.</p>
            <p>Using an emulator can also cause this error, see <a href="#faq">General Questions</a>.</p>
            <h3>“409: Failed to enter location”</h3>
            <p>Either the Netpass on your console is outdated, or you don&#39;t have StreetPass enabled on any game.
                Make sure you <a href="install.html">install the latest version,</a> and have at least 1 game with
                 StreetPass enabled.</p>

            <h2>Known Issues</h2>
            <h3>Not receiving passes for a specific title anymore</h3>
            <p>Please check the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is StreetPass enabled in that title?</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Check System Settings → Data Management → StreetPass Management</li>
                    <li>Check NetPass → Settings → Toggle Games</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Do you already have a full queue in that title? (Check Home Menu → Notifications)</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>NetPass can only download more StreetPasses once you make room by using the already
                         present ones</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <h3>I cannot send SwapNote letters to my friends</h3>
            <p>That feature depends on SpotPass, which got discontinued by Nintendo. NetPass only works with
                 StreetPass.</p>
