            <h2>Rules</h2>
            <p>
            Below you will find basic rules for using NetPass. Breaking them could result in a ban!    
            </p>
            <p>
1: Be nice to people and treat others with respect. No harassment, sexism, racism, hate speech, homophobia, transphobia, or anything of the sort. Be inclusive of others and their beliefs; we want this place to be welcome to all.
        </p>
        <p>
2: No NSFW, gore or obscene content. This applies to text, images, or links featuring nudity, sex, hard violence, or other graphically disturbing content. Swearing is allowed, but should be kept to a minimum and not be used as a way to insult/harm others.   
        </p>
        <p>
3: Do not discuss piracy or anything relating to piracy. Do not ask how to pirate games/updates/dlcs, firmware dumps, SDK's for consoles, etc. Do not share, discuss, hint or guide towards downloads links or tools which promote or encourage the use of piracy. 
        </p>
        <p>
4: No doxxing, malware, viruses, IP grabbers, media intended to crash the Discord client or brick/crash any system. Do not impersonate others & do not send other people's private information: this also applies to the sender sending their own private info.    
        </p>
        <p>
5: No unsolicited spam, scams, advertising, or (self-) promotion in the Discord server or in DMs. Posting links to things you’ve made is fine if it is relevant to the conversation. No unsolicited spam, scams, advertising, or corporate promotion in NetPass. Links to social media and things you’ve made are fine as long as it is personal work.
        </p>
        <p>
6: If you're hesitant to post something, it's better to ask for clarification or to not post it. Finding loopholes or trying to stay 'borderline' within the rules will be treated as breaking them. This also includes using channels for their intended purposes.
