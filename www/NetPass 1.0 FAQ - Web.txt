# :netpass:  Usage Guide


## Onboarding


Before you can use NetPass, an onboarding message will prompt you to install additional patches for additional features. This is a highly reccomended, but ultimatley optional step. You will need to enable sysmodule game patching in your Luma settings for the patches to work properly (you can do this by holding down on the Select button when your 3DS is booting up). After these patches are installed and you’ve enabled game patching, **make sure your 3DS system reboots** before opening NetPass again. If an update to the patches is available, the onboarding screen will appear again.


## Getting StreetPasses


1. Firstly, launch NetPass; your StreetPass data will begin to upload onto the server.
2. After your data is uploaded, you will see 6 different locations; once you choose and enter a location, you will begin to randomly pass people in that location for the next 10 hours.


- Important Notes:
  - You are unable to change or leave your location until your 10 hours have ran out.
  - After the 10-hour period ends, you will automatically leave the location, and then need to enter a different one to receive more passes.
  - All NetPass locations are equally as likely to give you passes; **there’s no ‘busy’ or ‘less busy’ option.**


## Please follow our rules when you share your StreetPass content with the NetPass server. Breaking them can result in a temporary, or even permanent ban.

# :question: Frequently Asked Questions


### What is SPR?
SPR stands for StreetPass Relay, which is a feature that allows your 3DS to download StreetPasses in the background while you keep it on idle or play your games.


### Do I have to leave the app open?
No, all StreetPass pairing happens on the server-side. You may receive these passes via SPR or by opening the app.


### How do I leave a location?
You will not be able to leave your location until your 10 hour cooldown is over.


### I saw content that is breaking the rules. How do I report it?
Please refer to the "Moderation and Reporting" section.


### Will normal StreetPass still work?
Yes, it will.


### My friend and I went to the same location, but we didn't pass each other. What gives?
The passes inside a location are totally random; for user-specific passes, you might be interested in Pretendo's version of StreetPass Relay.


### How is my data stored?
The moment you enter a location, your data from StreetPass-enabled games and your system’s MAC address is uploaded and stored in the NetPass server for 30 days; after the 30-day period ends, the data will be deleted.


Your MAC address is a string of numbers unique to your console. You can find your MAC address in your System Settings > Internet Settings > Other Information.

If you wish to erase your data, you can do so by going to the in-app settings and requesting for your data to be deleted; it then goes through an automatic deletion process.


### If I get banned from NetPass, will I also get banned on Nintendo/Pretendo, and vice versa?
No, we are different services and thus have different moderation teams.


### The StreetPass inbox for one of my games is full! Will my passes be deleted if I don’t clear it?
The server will continue to accumulate and hold onto passes for you, until you clear your inbox or 30 days pass.

# :netpalban: Moderation and Reporting


## How do I report unwanted/inappropriate content?


1. In your in-app settings, there should be a report button.
2. On the report screen, you can scroll and choose who to report. Clicking on a name will show the offender’s name and associated StreetPass Data.
3. Once you have selected the offender, click the A button to begin writing a report. Please include as much context as you can fit in the text box.

The report will then be shortly sent to the mod panel, which mods will validate and give punishment if necessary. All reports are manually reviewed, so please avoid submitting fake reports/spam; those who do will be punished.


## What content is report-worthy?


- Hate speech and discrimination (racism, sexism, LGBTQ-phobia, body shaming, extremist movements, etc.)
- NSFW of any kind (gore, nudity, hard violence, obscene & graphically disturbing content, etc.)
  - Swears are fine if not abused/meant to be harmful.
- Unsolicited spam/advertising, such as sharing a scam or suspicious link.
  - Social media is fine to share, as long as it is SFW.
- Sending/asking for personal data (phone number, address, full name, email, etc.) This includes your *own* personal data as well.
- Promoting or sharing piracy resources.


All in all, use your common sense; would you be ok with a 13 year-old seeing it?

# :exclamation: Known Errors

### “libCURL error 28: Timeout was reached”
Try opening NetPass again, or try a different network; yours might be unstable/too slow. This error could also mean that the server is down; if that’s the case, try again later.


### “libCURL error 60: Make sure that your system’s date and time are set correctly!”
Like the error says, make sure the date and time on your console is correct.
1. Open the Rosalina menu (L + DPAD Down + SELECT at the same time).
2. Go to Miscellaneous options.
3. Click on "update the time via NTP" (you need an internet connection to do this) and use the DPAD Left/Right to change your hour offset; press A, and your clock should be set up correctly.


### “HTTP 403”
You are most likely banned; there should be a reason on the bottom screen as to why you were banned. If you don't see a reason for your ban, or want to know the length of said ban, please open a ticket in our Discord's Mod Mail channel.
Using an emulator can also cause this error; emulators are not officially supported, and we cannot help you.


### “ERROR: failed to enter location: -409”
Either the NetPass on your console is outdated, or you don't have StreetPass enabled on any game. Make sure you have the latest version installed, and have at least 1 game with StreetPass enabled.


## If you get an error that is not listed here:
Please ask for help in our Discord's support channels.
